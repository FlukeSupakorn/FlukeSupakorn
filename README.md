## 💼 Experience
### **Gofive Company Limited** — Full Stack Developer Intern (Jun 2025 – Jul 2025)
- Built a custom **File Manager system** for production, replacing a paid third-party Syncfusion solution. Designed a full-featured interface with a left-side folder tree (MUI Tree View) and a right-side file explorer, supporting search, sorting, and additional file operations. Implemented the entire UI and logic from scratch for real-world use in a complex enterprise project.
- Led the complete migration of a large-scale application from **Next.js Page Router → App Router**. Independently researched, planned, and executed the transition to modernize architecture for scalability and long-term maintainability.
- Optimized performance after migration by conducting in-depth research on dataflow/rendering bottlenecks, then refactored core modules into server/client components—reducing bundle size and significantly improving load/render times.
- Developed a **User Management System** with full CRUD operations and integrated role-based access control, enabling administrators to manage users and define detailed permissions across modules and features.
- Integrated `data-testid` throughout the codebase to enhance automated testability and maintained/expanded unit test coverage to prevent regressions.
